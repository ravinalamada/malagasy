# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Remove unused code and files. Only have the most advanced version of a component in the codebase. 
2. Duplicated Stylesheets, think about how to merge the objects containig the styles
3. Instead of huge if-statements, use objects 

## Components

- Next button 4/5
- Action button 5/5
- Tool buttons 5/5
- Language Switcher 4/5
- Section Heading 5/5
- List item 5/5
- List 3/5
- Textarea 4/5
- U1 9/10  
- U8 8/10 => Display good, data is not really randomized as there can be duplications
- U9 5/10 => You were on a good way there, some aspects are still missing though
- Any other successfull user story: U10, U11, U7 => 30pt. nice work :)
- Github workflow 7/10 // Pull requests and rebasing good, descriptions could be longer and should contain the clickup link. Naming of commits + pull requests should not start with "I did x" instead from the components point of view
- No spelling mistakes: 4/5
- Clickup workflow: 2/3
- Use of screen navigation 5/5
- React Context: 5/5
- Reducer 0/5
